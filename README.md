# XRobot Framework

Just a LEGO Robot Framework made in Java for the Class X of ICT Engineering 2015.

## Target

We're trying to make our project work properly with an easy-to-use complete framework
to make all the needed actions and having all the needed information to everything we need
with our LeJOT NXT robot.

It can easily be converted to LeJOT EV3 by someone, just push your branch and I will take
a look at it.

## Co-Workers

The Framework has been started by me (Luca Massiliano "d3vil401" Francioni) and actually under my
control and work, but the other group members actually are helping me and building the robot:

* not in order of priority *


- Vlado Roƒçin

- Ovidiu Chelaru

- Kalina Konstantinova

## Using The Framework

This framework is not a library yet but it's easy to use.
**If you are planning to use this framework to simplify your school project, I absolutely not
recommend it since it has my credits and it's an advanced work (not really).**

## About Credits

Please, just leave my Logo or initial credits, it's just about respect: if you do something and
want to make it open to everyone so you all can study and understand things better, you 
absolutely would like to see a "thanks" from the other users, which is just leaving my name there.

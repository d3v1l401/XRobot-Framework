# XRobot Framework

Just a LEGO Robot Framework made in Java for the Class X of ICT Engineering 2015.

# Target

We're trying to make our project work properly with an easy-to-use complete framework
to make all the needed actions and having all the needed information to everything we need
with our LeJOT NXT robot.

It can easily be converted to LeJOT EV3 by someone, just push your branch and I will take
a look at it.
